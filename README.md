# ðŸ‘— Fashion-MNIST Classifier (PyTorch + Flask)
# ðŸ‘— Fashion-MNIST Classifier (PyTorch + Flask)

This project is a step-by-step learning journey into **deep learning with PyTorch**, starting with training a model on the [Fashion-MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist).

The long-term goal is to build a **web application** where users can upload an image of clothing, and the trained model will predict the fashion category.

## ðŸš€ Steps to Run

1. **Train the Model**
   - Run:  
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook notebook/f_mnist_train.ipynb
     ```
   - This trains a PyTorch CNN on Fashion-MNIST.
   - Save the model weights to `models/fashion_mnist.pth`.

2. **Preprocessing**
   - Run:
     ```bash
     python scripts/preprocess.py
     ```
   - Resizes and converts uploaded images into the same format as Fashion-MNIST (grayscale 28Ã—28).  

3. **Prediction**
   - Run:
     ```bash
     python scripts/predict.py
     ```
   - Loads the trained model and runs inference on processed images.  

4. **Web App (coming soon)**
   - `app/app.py` will provide a Flask interface to upload an image and see the modelâ€™s prediction in the browser.
